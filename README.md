# Column Formatting Samples

This repository contains samples for column formatting in modern lists and document libraries. Each sample has it's own folder in the repository and contains a README for setup and usage in SharePoint Online.

## Available Column Formatting Samples
- Add icon links to Site Settings, Site Security and Site Contents based on Site Url field
- Add filter links for header/details lists

## Notes
- If you create or maintain the JSON code, use a JSON editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This will make life much easier!

- Use the _Preview_ mode **extensively**, it will show mistakes in JSON immediately. Wrongly formatted JSON will not be parsed and generates an error message below the JSON box. It will not show you were the mistake is made. Using a code editor like the one mentioned before is more likely to show you erros in parsed JSON code.
